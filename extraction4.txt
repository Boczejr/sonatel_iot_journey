NB-IOT vEPC feature requirement
Exist network analysis:
1. Exist vEPC version is  V100R020C05, support NB-IoT feature.
2. NB-IoT license is not exist on vEPC.
Feature request analysis：
CloudUSN                                                                                            CloudUGW

--- Slide 4 ---
NB-IOT vEPC interface variation
Add new logic interface S11-U, use private IP design on CloudUSN and DGW.

S1 、 S10 、 S11 、 S5&S8 、 S6a、NAS interface variation and CDR information is strengthened.

New APN for NB-IoT need to be designed on CloudCGW&DGW.
Interface design

--- Slide 5 ---
Deploy & Test case
The main actions for deploy：

LLD design for NB-IOT.

2.  Create new S11-U interface and configure IP routing between CloudUSN and CloudDGW.

3.  Create new DNSN on CloudUSN, point to CloudUGW. 

4.  Create  new APN on CloudCGW, need check with Sonatel if need use specific VPN and IP pool,  static IP or dynamic IP for user；

5.  Create new VPN and IP route configuration  on CloudCGW and PE if use new VPN. 

6.  Service test and verify.
Test case based on license availability on CloudUSN and CloudUGW ：

 IP Data Over NAS

Non-IP MO/MT Data over NAS

3.   eNodeB Coverage Level Based Paging (optional)

4.   Power Saving Mode Activation  (optional)

5.   NB-IoT eDRX Mode Activation (optional)

6.   NB-IoT SMS Transmission Over SGs (optional)
